        <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian layered dessert with rum-flavored, coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a creamy mascarpone custard, and whipped cream. This tiramisu recipe is easy to make at home for an impressive no-bake dessert.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated tiramisu recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Egg Yolks:</b> Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne illness.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to create a sweet, creamy filling.</li>
            <li><b>Milk:</b> Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable texture.</li>
            <li><b>Cream:</b> Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped cream.</li>
            <li><b>Vanilla:</b> Vanilla extract adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.</li>
            <li><b>Mascarpone:</b> Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste, is a key ingredient in classic tiramisu.</li>
            <li><b>Coffee:</b> Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee — this is what gives tiramisu its signature flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Rum:</b> Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled over the ladyfingers. Some Allrecipes community members say they prefer Kahlua.</li>
            <li><b>Ladyfingers:</b> Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are shaped like thick fingers. If you can't find ladyfingers at your grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into strips.</li>
            <li><b>Cocoa Powder:</b> Finish off this decadent dessert with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.</li>
        </ul>
